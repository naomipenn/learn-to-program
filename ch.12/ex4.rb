#Birthday helper! Write a program to read in names and birth dates from a text file. It should then ask you for a name. You type one in, and it tells you when that personâ€™s next birthday will be (and, for the truly adventurous, how old they will be). The input file should look something like this:

#still tinkering

birth_dates = {}
  File.read('birthdays.txt').each_line do |line|
    line = line.chomp
    first_comma = 0
    while line[first_comma] != ',' &&
        first_comma < line.length
      first_comma = first_comma + 1
    end
    name = line[0..(first_comma - 1)]
    date = line[-12..-1]
    birth_dates[name] = date
  end
puts 'Whose birthday would you like to know?'
name = gets.chomp
date = birth_dates[name]
if date == nil
  puts 'Sorry, I\'ve got nada.'
else
  puts date[0..18]
end
