#“Old-school Roman numerals. In the early days of Roman numerals, the Romans didn’t bother with any of this new-fangled subtraction “IX” nonsense. No sir, it was straight addition, biggest to littlest—so 9 was written “VIIII,” and so on. Write a method that when passed an integer between 1 and 3000 (or so) returns a string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral. In other words, old_roman_numeral 4 should return 'IIII'. Make sure to test your method on a bunch of different numbers. Hint: Use the integer division and modulus methods here.

def oldroman_numeral num
  roman = ''
  roman = roman + 'M' * (num / 1000)
  roman = roman + 'D' * (num % 1000 / 500)
  roman = roman + 'C' * (num % 500 / 100)
  roman = roman + 'L' * (num % 100 / 50)
  roman = roman + 'X' * (num % 50 / 10)
  roman = roman + 'V' * (num % 10 / 5)
  roman = roman + 'I' * (num % 5 /1)
  roman
end
